<p>We feel that we've reached the limits of what seems reasonable to
accomplish in shell. So we're switching to Rust!</p>

<p>Stay tuned, exciting things will be happening soon.</p>

<p>Hermit is a home directory configuration management tool that
facilitates moving between different computers without losing your
shell (configurations).</p>

<p>Hermit was originally inspired by <a href="https://github.com/jim/briefcase">Briefcase</a> which solves the same
problem.  However, Briefcase is written in Ruby.  We wanted something
more trivially portable. Since your shell configuration is so basic,
it seemed like having minimal dependencies would be a good
thing. Currently Hermit is dependent on the bash shell, but we hope to
make it depend solely on POSIX shell capabilities to maximize
portability.</p>

<p>The code infrastructure is heavily borrowed from the awesome shell
tools <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv">rbenv</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/creationix/nvm">nvm</a>.</p>

<p><em>Hermit is currently alpha software. I use it and we have a reasonable
number of tests, but there may (will!) be bugs.</em></p>

<a id="the-problem" class="anchor" href="#the-problem" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Problem</h2>

<p>Hermit aims to alleviate three separate but related problems related
to keeping your dotfiles under source control.</p>

<ol>
<li>Not having the source control directory in your home root</li>
<li>Facilitating sym-link management because of #1</li>
<li>Having secret information in your dotfiles that is NOT committed to
git</li>
</ol>

<p><sub>This section was inspired by David Nolen's talk given to
<a href="https://www.recursecenter.com/">The Recurse Center</a> about "Solution Oriented Language."</sub></p>

<h2>
<a id="philosophy" class="anchor" href="#philosophy" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Philosophy</h2>

<p>Hermit is dependent on Git for much of it's functionality. In fact, if
you don't know how to use Git, Hermit won't be very useful for
you. This is because Hermit as a tool fundamentally collaborates with
Git.</p>

<p>Hermit commands are mostly wrappers around the corresponding Git
commands. But Hermit always adds some extra behavior on top of what
Git normally does. As a convenience, Hermit also provides a way to run
arbitrary Git commands against your dotfiles repository without
<code>cd</code>ing to that directory.</p>

<p>Hermit aims to be an assistant; it's not trying to run the show. As a
consequence, Hermit will never actually commit anything to your
profile repository. Instead - like the perfect office assistant -
Hermit will prepare everything for you, and then let you decide
whether or not to commit it. This gives you the option of reviewing
exactly the changes that Hermit is proposing to make to your profile
and helps you avoid accidentally committing any secrets.</p>

<a id="install" class="anchor" href="#install" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Install</h2>

<h3>
<a id="use-git" class="anchor" href="#use-git" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Use Git</h3>

<p>You're going to need <code>git</code> to make use of <code>hermit</code>, so just make sure
you have <code>git</code> <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">installed</a> and then clone the repo.</p>

<pre><code>git clone git@github.com:RadicalZephyr/hermit.git ~/.hermit
</code></pre>

<p>Now, you need to have <code>~/.hermit/bin</code> on your path, so add something
like this to your shell init file:</p>

<pre><code>export PATH="$PATH":~/.hermit/bin
</code></pre>

<h2>
<a id="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h2>

<p>Still working on this... Check out the <a href="https://github.com/RadicalZephyr/hermit/tree/master/doc/tutorial.md">tutorial</a>, or peruse the
<a href="https://github.com/RadicalZephyr/hermit/tree/master/doc">docs folder</a> or run <code>hermit help</code>.</p>

<pre><code>Usage: hermit &lt;command&gt; [&lt;args&gt;]

Some useful hermit commands are:
   commands    List all available hermit commands
   init        Start a new hermit profile
   clone       Create a local hermit from an existing remote hermit
   status      Display the status of your hermit
   use         Switch to using a different profile
   add         Add files to your hermit directory
   update      Update redacted files already stored in git

See `hermit help &lt;command&gt;' for information on a specific command.

<h2>
<a id="running-the-tests" class="anchor" href="#running-the-tests" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Running the Tests</h2>

<p>Hermit now has a test suite! You can run it with <code>./runtests.sh</code>.</p>

<h2>
<a id="where-were-headed" class="anchor" href="#where-were-headed" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Where We're Headed</h2>

<p>Checkout our <a href="https://waffle.io/bike-barn/hermit">Waffle.io</a> board for a more organized view of
what's going on in the project.</p>

<h2>
<a id="contributing" class="anchor" href="#contributing" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Contributing</h2>

<p>First, please take a look at our
<a href="https://github.com/bike-barn/hermit/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">CONTRIBUTING.md</a>. Next, probably check out our
<a href="https://waffle.io/bike-barn/hermit">Waffle.io</a> board, and look at the size 1 issues in the To-Do
column. From there, the standard "<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/">fork</a>, <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/">branch</a>, code,
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/">pull request</a>" workflow works well.</p>

<p>As a bonus, if you use the waffle.io
<a href="https://github.com/waffleio/waffle.io/wiki/FAQs#branch-moving">branch naming scheme</a> for the issue you're working on,
it will automatically update our Waffle board.</p>
