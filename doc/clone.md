# `clone` command

Clone allows you to retrieve a pre-existing git directory to use as a
hermit profile. The argument is passed straight through to git, so
anything that can be passed to git clone is fair game.  The optional
second argument to hermit clone allows you to specify the profile name
for this repository.
