# `doctor` command

## (Unimplemented!)

Inspired by homebrew's excellent doctor command, this will help make
sure that your hermit environment is sane and consistent.

The things it should look for:

- Having a properly configured and updated hermit
- That any environment variables are sane
- and other things...
