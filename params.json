So we're switching to Rust!\r\n\r\nStay tuned, exciting things will be happening soon.\r\n\r\nBring your home with you\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.zephyrizing.net/hermit/images/hermit-crab.png\"\r\n alt=\"Hermit Logo\" title=\"The Crab\" align=\"right\" />\r\n\r\nHermit is a home directory configuration management tool that\r\nfacilitates moving between different computers without losing your\r\nshell (configurations).\r\n\r\nHermit was originally inspired by [Briefcase] which solves the same\r\nproblem.  However, Briefcase is written in Ruby.  We wanted something\r\nmore trivially portable. Since your shell configuration is so basic,\r\nit seemed like having minimal dependencies would be a good\r\nthing. Currently Hermit is dependent on the bash shell, but we hope to\r\nmake it depend solely on POSIX shell capabilities to maximize\r\nportability.\r\n\r\nThe code infrastructure is heavily borrowed from the awesome shell\r\ntools [rbenv], and [nvm].\r\n\r\n_Hermit is currently alpha software. I use it and we have a reasonable\r\nnumber of tests, but there may (will!) be bugs._\r\n\r\n[![License GPL 3][badge-license]](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt)\r\n[![Build Status][badge-build]](https://travis-ci.org/bike-barn/hermit)\r\n[![Stories Ready to Work On][badge-todo]](https://waffle.io/bike-barn/hermit)\r\n[![Crabs harmed][badge-crabs]](http://shields.io/)\r\n\r\n[badge-license]: https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPL_3-green.svg\r\n[badge-build]: https://travis-ci.org/bike-barn/hermit.svg?branch=master\r\n[badge-todo]: https://badge.waffle.io/bike-barn/hermit.svg?label=to-do&title=To-Do\r\n[badge-crabs]: http://img.shields.io/badge/crabs_harmed-0-blue.svg\r\n\r\n[Briefcase]: https://github.com/jim/briefcase\r\n[rbenv]: https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv\r\n[nvm]: https://github.com/creationix/nvm\r\n\r\nThe Problem\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nHermit aims to alleviate three separate but related problems related\r\nto keeping your dotfiles under source control.\r\n\r\n1. Not having the source control directory in your home root\r\n2. Facilitating sym-link management because of #1\r\n3. Having secret information in your dotfiles that is NOT committed to\r\n   git\r\n\r\n<sub>This section was inspired by David Nolen's talk given to\r\n[The Recurse Center][RC] about \"Solution Oriented Language.\"</sub>\r\n\r\n[RC]: https://www.recursecenter.com/\r\n\r\nPhilosophy\r\n----------\r\n\r\nHermit is dependent on Git for much of it's functionality. In fact, if\r\nyou don't know how to use Git, Hermit won't be very useful for\r\nyou. This is because Hermit as a tool fundamentally collaborates with\r\nGit.\r\n\r\nHermit commands are mostly wrappers around the corresponding Git\r\ncommands. But Hermit always adds some extra behavior on top of what\r\nGit normally does. As a convenience, Hermit also provides a way to run\r\narbitrary Git commands against your dotfiles repository without\r\n`cd`ing to that directory.\r\n\r\nHermit aims to be an assistant; it's not trying to run the show. As a\r\nconsequence, Hermit will never actually commit anything to your\r\nprofile repository. Instead - like the perfect office assistant -\r\nHermit will prepare everything for you, and then let you decide\r\nwhether or not to commit it. This gives you the option of reviewing\r\nexactly the changes that Hermit is proposing to make to your profile\r\nand helps you avoid accidentally committing any secrets.\r\n\r\nInstall\r\n-------\r\n\r\n### Use Git\r\n\r\nYou're going to need `git` to make use of `hermit`, so just make sure\r\nyou have `git` [installed][install-git] and then clone the repo.\r\n\r\n    git clone git@github.com:RadicalZephyr/hermit.git ~/.hermit\r\n\r\nNow, you need to have `~/.hermit/bin` on your path, so add something\r\nlike this to your shell init file:\r\n\r\n    export PATH=\"$PATH\":~/.hermit/bin\r\n\r\n[install-git]: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Getting-Started-Installing-Git\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nStill working on this... Check out the [tutorial], or peruse the\r\n[docs folder][hermit-docs] or run `hermit help`.\r\n\r\n[tutorial]: https://github.com/RadicalZephyr/hermit/tree/master/doc/tutorial.md\r\n[hermit-docs]: https://github.com/RadicalZephyr/hermit/tree/master/doc\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nUsage: hermit <command> [<args>]\r\n\r\nSome useful hermit commands are:\r\n   commands    List all available hermit commands\r\n   init        Start a new hermit profile\r\n   clone       Create a local hermit from an existing remote hermit\r\n   status      Display the status of your hermit\r\n   use         Switch to using a different profile\r\n   add         Add files to your hermit directory\r\n   update      Update redacted files already stored in git\r\n\r\nSee `hermit help <command>' for information on a specific command.\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning the Tests\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nHermit now has a test suite! You can run it with `./runtests.sh`.\r\n\r\nWhere We're Headed\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nCheckout our [Waffle.io][waffle] board for a more organized view of\r\nwhat's going on in the project.\r\n\r\n[waffle]: https://waffle.io/bike-barn/hermit\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n------------\r\n\r\nFirst, please take a look at our\r\n[CONTRIBUTING.md][contributing].
