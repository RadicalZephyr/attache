Documentation Comments:

1) Unclear by what first sentence of READ.ME means. It would be really
useful to have a couple of sentences elaborating on what exactly this
does in a different way. Also, why is hermit good? It seems like
Hermit allows you to port shell configurations between machines, which
is super useful and convenient, so you should say something like that!

2) I'm a little confused on how Hermit interacts with git

4) Overall documentation was clear and concisely written. I would
recommend cleaning up the "redacting" section. It might be useful to
create a section where you are explaining the concept of redacting and
then how it relates to Hermit, which is currently combined into one
section.

Hermit sounds awesome! Great work! I hope to eventually be cool enough
to use it :)
