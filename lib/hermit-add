# Summary: Add files to your hermit directory
# Usage: hermit add [<filepattern>â€¦]
#
# Add takes a path (or paths) to some files and directories in your
# home folder, and moves them into your active hermit profile, and
# then creates a symlink to this moved file in the original location.
#
# Adding a directory is essentially a shorthand for adding all files
# in that directory tree.
#
#  Note: you must have an initialized hermit profile.
