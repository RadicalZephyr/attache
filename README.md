Attach√© - Bring your home with you
==================================

A home directory configuration management tool. Inspired originally by
[Briefcase](https://github.com/jim/briefcase) but also heavily borrows
from awesome tools like [rbenv], and [nvm]. It's (going to be) like
having profiles for your shell environments. Or, it just helps manage
your home directory being under version control.

[nvm]: https://github.com/creationix/nvm

Thoughts n' stuff

We've got a whole [themey-wemey] thing going on. Any suggestions or
problems with the names should take this into consideration ;)
