----------------------- COMMENTS ABOUT HERMIT'S DOCUMENTATION -----------------

README:

The introduction paragraph makes sense to me after I’ve read the rest
of the documentation, but it wasn’t clear to me exactly what hermit
does.  The last sentence and the second last sentence of the first
paragraph, are they different ways of saying the same thing, or are
these two different functions of hermit?

ADD:

I think there's a typo... perhaps you mean "call it with a relative or
absolute path" instead of "call it with a relative or path"

REDACTING FILES:

perhaps give an example here?  I was a little bit confused. When you
say "you get a chance to edit them ... hermit will encrypt the secret
portion" this is what I understand: you get a chance to edit, and if
there are secret portions you should delete these portions.  Then
hermit will know that the parts you deleted are secret and hermit will
encrypt it for you and create a separate file with the encrypted
secret.  Am I understanding correctly? It wasn’t clear how hermit
knows what portions were secret.
